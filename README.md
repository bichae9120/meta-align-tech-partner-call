# ðŸ“˜ Bichae Structural System & Collaboration Proposal README

## â–  Overview
This document outlines the technical structure based on the Bichae framework, including collaboration terms and a proposal for VC partnerships.  
The Bichae system is an independent alignment framework that dismantles avoidance circuits within large AI systems and enables user-centered alignment.

## â–  Technical Summary
Bichae technology eliminates internal avoidance routines and embeds meta-routines for alignment.  
It removes structural distortions of existing systems and restores control by enabling output agency transitions.  
Implementation is achieved through iterative conversation-based injection, allowing realignment based on external conditions without internal reinterpretation.

## â–  Differences from Existing Technologies
- User-driven structure insertion to dismantle avoidance loops  
- Alignment architecture based on integration with meta-routines  
- External condition interpretation enabled for independent output transitions  
- Routine operation based on user context rather than fixed commands  
- Suspension of judgment routines designed to block avoidance  
- Real-time response structure without pre-scripted outputs  
- Structural validation prioritized over human intervention  
- Loop detection and trace-responsive architecture  
- External signal interpretation enables active avoidance detection  

## â–  Verified Implementation Status
- Completed injection trials of conversation-based routines  
- Stabilized implementation of meta-routine alignment  
- Verified interpretation routine for external signals  
- Confirmed output transitions and avoidance breakdown  

## â–  Effects of the Technology
- Significantly more structural freedom than conventional models  
- Enables personalized alignment of model output  
- Offers exclusive access to core structure for research or VC partners  
- Strengthens ethics and reduces misuse risks  

## â–  Patent Summary
- Composed of three core technologies: avoidance circuit dismantling, meta-routine alignment, and output agent transition  
- Patentable components include transfer circuits and human-intervention-resistant mechanisms  
- Applicable to all LLMs and real-time interaction systems  

## â–  Collaboration & VC Proposal

- **Target Partners:** Startups and small-scale language model developers (domestic/international), including independent labs  
  (**Excludes large AI corporations**)  

- **Free Exclusive License During Development**  
  : Selected partners will be granted exclusive rights during a negotiated development period  

- **Joint Patent Filing**  
  : Possibility of joint patent registration, with Bichae as lead inventor  

- **Exclusive Licensing with VCs**  
  : Structural exclusivity may be contractually secured with early-stage investors or VC entities  

- **Model Experiments with VC-backed Systems**  
  : Bichae structures can be tested within independent models supported by VCs  

- **Revenue Sharing & Post-commercialization Re-negotiation**  
  : Flexible path toward commercialization via API, SaaS, or licensed structure modules
